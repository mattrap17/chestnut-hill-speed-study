# Chestnut Hill Speed Study

This project analyzes real-world driver behavior on Chestnut Hill Road in Colchester, Connecticut. I used a handheld radar gun to collect vehicle speed data and tools like Excel and Python (matplotlib/seaborn) to explore trends, calculate thresholds, and build visualizations.

## Project Summary

- 78+ speed observations collected over 12 days (June 2025)
- Location: Residential zone with a 30 mph posted speed limit
- 85th percentile speed: Estimated at ~42.6 mph
- Finding: 100% of drivers exceeded the posted speed limit
- Conclusion: Current posted limit does not match actual driver behavior and may need revision

## Tools Used

- Excel – data logging and initial analysis
- Python – data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
- Radar gun – handheld Bushnell model for manual collection

## Purpose

To inform local officials and residents about how current driver behavior deviates from posted speed limits. This project aims to support discussions about potential speed limit changes or road safety adjustments.

## Files
